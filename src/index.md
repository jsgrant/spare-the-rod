# THE INDEX / README.

!!! note
	This Book Is In **VERY-EARLY PRE-RELEASE**; Do Not Expect It To Be Even Close To A Readable State At This Point. Which Should Be Extremely Obvious Due To Lack Of Content, But I've Started Of Blocking Everything And Plan To Start Outlining The First-Draft Soon... But Don't Expect Anything In The First-Half Of 2020.

## What It Is?
'Spare The Rod' Is [My](https://github.com/jsgrant/) Explorations Into A General-Purpose, 101-Level  Computer-Science Textbook In And Around The Nim Systems Programming-Language [^1].

## TODO
- Everything.
